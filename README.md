# ChaTeX v2.0
A chat application I built for my minor project that lets users send mathematical equations along with text chat over the internet. (there is a separate repo for v1.0 [here](https://github.com/theoctober19th/ChaTeX-v1.0))

## ChangeLog
**v2.0**
1. Complete redesign of the UI
2. Now supports group messaging
3. Now supports sending location over the map.

## Credit
This chat application is highly inspired by this YouTube chat application series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGCjwl1RrtcQ3o2jmZtwu2wXEA4OIIq53
